\section{Groups of Order \(2p\)}
Now that we have seen groups of order 6, let's try and work towards a more general case: groups of
order 2 times a prime number.
So let \(G\) be a group of order \(2p\) where \(p\) is a prime number, and \(n_p\) denote the number
of Sylow p-subgroups of \(G\).
Then by Theorem~\ref{thm:sylow3}:
\[n_p \equiv 1 \ \text{(mod \(p\))} \quad \text{and} \quad n_p \mid 2 \implies n_p = 1\]
So \(G\) has one Sylow \(p\)-subgroup, say \(N\), and it is isomorphic to \(C_p\).
Let \(N = \langle x \rangle\).
A Sylow 2-subgroup, \(H \leqslant G\) will have order 2 so \(H \cong C_2\).
Let \(H = \langle y \rangle\).
Lagrange's Theorem tells us that \(N\) has elements of orders 1 and \(p\), and \(H\) has elements of
order 1 and 2 hence:
\[N \cap H = \bm{1}\]

By Lemma~\ref{lem:setprodorder}:
\[|NH| = |N| \cdot |H| = 2p\]
So \(G = N \rtimes H\) as before.

We know by Lemma~\ref{lem:aut} that \(\Aut{N} \cong \units{p}\), so let's look for the elements of
order 2.
An element \(x \in \units{p}\) of order 2 satisfies \(x^2 = 1\), hence \(x = 1\) or \(-1\).
But 1 has order 1, so \(x\) can only be \(-1\).
From the proof of Lemma~\ref{lem:aut}, this corresponds to the inverse map \(\beta:x \mapsto
x^{-1}\).

Now we want a homomorphism \(\psi: H \to \Aut{N}\).
By the same argument as for groups of order 6, we have two possibilities for \(G\):

\begin{enumerate}[\bfseries{Case} 1:]
    \item
        \begin{equation*}
        \begin{aligned}
            G &= \langle\, x, y \mid x^p = y^2 = 1,\ y^{-1}xy = x \,\rangle \\
            &= C_p \times C_2 \cong C_{2p}
        \end{aligned}
        \end{equation*}
    \item
        \begin{equation*}
        \begin{aligned}
            G &= \langle\, x, y \mid x^p = y^2 = 1,\ y^{-1}xy = x^{-1}
            \,\rangle \\
            &\cong D_{2p}
        \end{aligned}
        \end{equation*}
\end{enumerate}

Again, these are clearly not isomorphic, because \(C_{2p}\) is abelian, and \(D_{2p}\) is not.

Hence a group of order \(2p\) is isomorphic to one of:
\[C_{2p} \quad \text{or} \quad D_{2p}\]
