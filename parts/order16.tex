% ====   Order 16   ====
\section{Groups of Order 16}
The following classification is based of the one by Wild\footcite{order16}.
For brevity, denote \(C_2 \times C_2 \times C_2 \times C_2\) by \({(C_2)}^4\).
We begin by proving a lemma:

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:order_16_subgp}
    For a group, \(G\), with order 16, not isomorphic to \({(C_2)}^4\), then \(G\) has a
    normal subgroup isomorphic to either \(C_8\) or \(C_4 \times C_2\).
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    Firstly, we know that a subgroup with index 2 is normal, so any subgroup of order 8 in \(G\) is normal.
    So it remains to show \(G\) possesses such subgroups.
    If some \(x \in G\) has order 8, then \(\gen{x} \cong C_8\) and we are done.
    So assume \(G\) has no element of order 8.

    Because \(G \ncong {(C_2)}^4\), there is at least one element of order 4 in \(G\), say \(y\).
    By Lemma~\ref{lem:z_non_trivial}, there is some element \(z \in \z(G)\) which has order 2.
    Let \(H = \gen{z}\).
    Moreover, \(H \nrmsgp G\) because \(z\) is in the centre.

    If \(y^2 \neq z\), then \(\gen{y} \cap H = \bm{1}\), so \(\gen{y,\,z} \cong C_4 \times C_2\).

    If then all elements of order 4 in \(G\) have \(y^2 = z\), all elements in \(G/H\) have order 2.
    Thus \(G/H \cong {(C_2)}^3\), and in particular, is abelian.
    So the conjugacy class of \(y\), \(y^G\) is a subgroup of \(yH\).
    Hence the centraliser of \(y\), \(\C_G(y)\), has order 8.

    Let \(g \in \C_G(y) \setminus \gen{y}\).
    If \(g\) has order 2, then \(\gen{y,\,g} \cong C_4 \times C_2\).
    If \(g\) has order 4, then:
    \[g^2 = z \quad \text{and} \quad {(yg)}^2 = y^2 g^2 = z^2 = 1\]
    We can see that \(yg \notin \gen{y}\) because then, \(yg = y^2\) which gives the contradiction \(y = g\).
    So \(\gen{y,\,yg} \cong C_4 \times C_2\).
\end{proof}

Since we know already that \({(C_2)}^4\) is a group of order 16 by the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, we
will concentrate on when \(G\) is not isomorphic to \({(C_2)}^4\).
If \(N\) is the subgroup of \(G\) specified by Lemma~\ref{lem:order_16_subgp}, we will classify the groups by extending
\(N\) in different ways.
Pick some element \(a \in G \setminus N\).
Then the order of \(aN\) is two, (it must be either 1 or 2, and cannot be 1 because that contradicts our choice of
\(a\)) and \(a^2\) is in \(N\).
We know already what the possible automorphisms of \(C_8\) and \(C_4 \times C_2\) are from our classification of groups
of order 24.
They are summarised in Tables~\ref{tab:aut_C8}~and~\ref{tab:aut_C4xC2}.

\begin{table}
    \begin{minipage}{0.5\linewidth}
        \caption{Automorphisms of \(C_8\)}\label{tab:aut_C8}
        \centering
        \begin{tabular}{c|c}
            \(\Aut{C_8}\) & \(x \mapsto\) \\
            \midrule
            \(\phi_1\) & \(x\) \\
            \(\phi_2\) & \(x^3\) \\
            \(\phi_3\) & \(x^5\) \\
            \(\phi_4\) & \(x^{-1}\)
        \end{tabular}
    \end{minipage}
    \begin{minipage}{0.5\linewidth}
        \caption{Automorphisms of \(C_4 \times C_2\)}\label{tab:aut_C4xC2}
        \centering
        \begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c}
            \(\Aut{C_8}\) & \(x \mapsto\) & \(y \mapsto\) & Order \\
            \midrule
            \(\psi_1\) & \(x\) & \(y\) & 1\\
            \(\psi_2\) & \(x^3 y\) & \(x^2 y\) & 4 \\
            \(\psi_3\) & \(x^3\) & \(y\) & 2 \\
            \(\psi_4\) & \(xy\) & \(x^2 y\) & 4 \\
            \(\psi_5\) & \(xy\) & \(y\) & 2 \\
            \(\psi_6\) & \(x^3\) & \(x^2 y\) & 2\\
            \(\psi_7\) & \(x^3 y\) & \(y\) & 2 \\
            \(\psi_8\) & \(x\) & \(x^2 y\) & 2 \\
        \end{tabular}
    \end{minipage}
\end{table}

So now by considering choices for the order of \(a\) and automorphisms of \(N\), we will classify \(G\).
Begin with \(\gen{x} = N \cong C_8\).

\begin{enumerate}[\bfseries{Case} 1:]
    \item Order 2.

        If \(a\) has order 2, then \(a^2\) must be 1.
        So then \(N \cap \gen{a} = \bm{1}\), so \(G = N \rtimes \gen{a}\).
        We have 4 possible semidirect products, because each of the automorphisms of \(N\) have order 2 (excluding the
        identity map).
        Hence we obtain the following 4 groups:
        \begin{equation*}
        \begin{aligned}
            G_1 &= \gen{x,\,a \mid x^8 = a^2 = 1,\ a^{-1}xa = x} \\
                &= \gen{x} \times \gen{a} \\
                &\cong C_8 \times C_2 \\
            G_2 &= \gen{x,\,a \mid x^8 = a^2 = 1,\ a^{-1}xa = x^{3}} \\
                &= \gen{x} \rtimes_3 \gen{a} \\
                &\cong \SD_{16}\\
            G_3 &= \gen{x,\,a \mid x^8 = a^2 = 1,\ a^{-1}xa = x^{5}} \\
                &= \gen{x} \rtimes_5 \gen{a} \\
                &\cong \M_{16}\\
            G_4 &= \gen{x,\,a \mid x^8 = a^2 = 1,\ a^{-1}xa = x^{-1}} \\
                &= \gen{x} \rtimes_{-1} \gen{a} \\
                &\cong D_{16}
        \end{aligned}
        \end{equation*}
        We are subscripting \(\rtimes\) with the power of \(x\) it gets sent to upon conjugation with \(a\).
        The group \(\SD_{16}\) is known as the \emph{semidihedral group}\footcite{semidihedral}, of order 16, and
        \(\M_{16}\) is called the \emph{modular group}\footcite{order16names} of order 16.

    \item Order 4.

        Assume all elements in \(G\setminus N\) have order at least 4, otherwise we are back in the first case.
        How does conjugation behave?
        In particular, what is \(a^{-1}ga\) for an element \(g \in G\)?
        I claim the only possibility is the automorphism \(\phi_4:x\mapsto x^{-1}\).
        It cannot be \(\phi_2:x\mapsto x^3\) because then:
        \[(xa)(xa) = x(axa^{-1})a^2 = x(x^3) a^2 = x^4 a^2 = 1\]
        Likewise, it cannot be \(\phi_1:x\mapsto x\) or \(\phi_3:x\mapsto x^5\) because then \(x^2 a\) will have order 2:
        \[{(x^2 a)}^2 = x^2 (ax^2 a^{-1})a^2 = x^2 {(x^2)}^5 a^2 = x^4 a^2 = 1\]
        All of which contradict our assumption.
        Hence the only posibility for the effect of conjugation by \(a\) is the map \(\phi_4:x\mapsto x^7 = x^{-1}\).
        So we obtain the presentation:
        \begin{align*}
            G_5 &= \gen{x,\,a \mid x^8 = a^4 = 1,\ a^2 = x^4,\ a^{-1}xa = x^{-1}}
        \end{align*}
        Which we recognise as the dicyclic group, \(\Dic_{24}\).

    \item Order 8.

        It turns out, we obtain no new groups in this case.
        We have two choices for \(a\): \(a^2 = x^2\) or \(a^2 = x^6\).
        Because \(x^2\) and \(x^6\) are automorphic, we only need to consider one case, say \(a^2 = x^2\), and apply
        Lemma~\ref{lem:semiisom}.
        If conjugation by \(a\) is either \(\phi_2:x\mapsto x^3\) or \(\phi_4:x\mapsto x^7\) then we obtain a
        contradiction:
        \[a^2 = a^{-1}a^2 a = a^{-1}x^2 a = x^6\]
        \[a^2 = a^{-1}a^2 a = a^{-1}x^2 a = x^{14} = x^6\]
        Hence the only possibilities for conjugation by \(a\) are the maps \(\phi_1:x\mapsto x\) and \(\phi_3:x \mapsto
        x^5\).
        For the first:
        \[(x^3 a)(x^3 a) = x^3(ax^3 a^{-1})a^2 = x^3 x^3 a^2 = x^8 = 1\]
        a contradiction.
        And the second:
        \[(xa)(xa) = x(axa^{-1})a^2 = x(x^5)a^2 = x^8 = 1\]
        another contradiction.
        Hence we obtain no new groups.

    \item Order 16.

        The only possibility here is \(G_6 \cong C_{16}\), generated by \(a\).
\end{enumerate}

Now let's move on to consider when \(\gen{x,\,y} = N \cong C_4 \times C_2\).
In particular, all elements of \(G\) have order less than 8.

I claim we can disregard automorphisms of order 4, namely \(\psi_2\) and \(\psi_4\), because they lead to contradictions.
Consider an element \(g \in N\).
We can write \(g = x^i y^j\) for some \(0 \leq i \leq 3\) and \(0 \leq j \leq 1\).
Then on the one hand:
\[a^{-2}ga^2 = g\]
Because \(N\) is abelian.
On the other:
\begin{align*}
    a^{-2}ga^2 &= a^{-1}(a^{-1}x^i\,y^j a)a \\
    &= a^{-1}(x^i\psi_2\ y^j\psi_2)a \\
    &= a^{-1}(x^{-i}y^i\ x^{2j}y^j)a \\
    &= a^{-1}(x^{2j-i}\ y^{i+j})a \\
    &= x^{i-2j}y^{2j-i}\ x^{2i+2j}y^{i+j} \\
    &= x^{3i}y^{3j} \\
    &= y^j x^{-i}
\end{align*}
Which is \(g^{-1}\).
Hence we have \(g = g^{-1}\) which is a contradiction, because \(x \in N\) has order 4.
A similar contradiction can be shown for \(\psi_4\).

The automorphisms \(\psi_5\) and \(\psi_7\) are conjugate, as are \(\psi_6\) and \(\psi_8\).

\begin{enumerate}[\bfseries{Case} 1:]
    \item Order 2.

        If \(a\) has order 2, then \(a^2 = 1\), so \(\gen{a} \cap N = \bm{1}\).
        Hence \(G = N \rtimes \gen{a}\).
        So we can apply Lemma~\ref{lem:semiisom}, and only consider one representative from each conjugacy class.
        We have the following presentations:
        \begin{align*}
            G_7 &= \gen{x,\,y,\,a \mid x^4 = y^2 = a^2 = 1,\ xy = yx,\ a^{-1}xa = x,\ a^{-1}ya = y} \\
                &= \gen{x} \times \gen{y} \times \gen{a} \\
                &\cong C_4 \times C_2 \times C_2 \\
            G_8 &= \gen{x,\,y,\,a \mid x^4 = y^2 = a^2 = 1,\ xy = yx,\ a^{-1}xa = x^{-1},\ a^{-1}ya = y} \\
                &= (\gen{x} \rtimes \gen{a}) \times \gen{y} \\
                &\cong D_8 \times C_2 \\
            G_9 &= \gen{x,\,y,\,a \mid x^4 = y^2 = a^2 = 1,\ xy = yx,\ a^{-1}xa = xy,\ a^{-1}ya = y} \\
                &= (\gen{x} \times \gen{y}) \rtimes \gen{a} \\
                &\cong (C_4 \times C_2) \rtimes C_2 \tag{nameless} \\
            G_{10} &= \gen{x,\,y,\,a \mid x^4 = y^2 = a^2 = 1,\ xy = yx,\ a^{-1}xa = x^{-1},\ a^{-1}ya = x^2 y}\\
        \end{align*}
        The final group, \(G_{10}\), is sometimes called the \emph{Pauli group}\footcite{order16names}, because it
        consists of the Pauli Matrices from quantum mechanics, and their products with powers of \(i\).
        The group \(G_9\) doesn't appear to have any significant name.

    \item Order 4.

        As before, assume all elements in \(G\setminus N\) have order at least 4.
        We have 3 choices for \(a\) here, and will break them into subcases:
        \begin{enumerate}[\bfseries A:]
            \item \(a^2 = x^2\).

                Firstly, let's show what conjugation by \(a\) cannot be.
                If it's \(\phi_1\):
                \[(xa)(xa) = xa^2(a^{-1}xa) = xa^2 x = 1\]
                If it's \(\phi_6\):
                \[(xya)(xya) = xya^2(a^{-1}xya) = xya^2(x^{-1}x^2y) = x^4 y^2 = 1\]
                If it's \(\phi_8\):
                \[(x^2 ya)(x^2 ya) = x^2 ya^2 (a^{-1}x^2 ya) = x^2 ya^2(x^2 x^2 y) = x^8 y^2 = 1\]
                All of which are contradictions to our assumption.
                So the remaining possibilities are:
                \begin{align*}
                    G_{11} &= \gen{x,\,y,\,a \mid x^4 = y^2 = a^4 = 1,\ xy = yx,\ a^{-1}xa = x^{-1},\ a^{-1}ya = y} \\
                        &= \gen{x,\,a} \times \gen{y} \\
                        &\cong Q_8 \times C_2 \\
                    G_{12a} &= \gen{x,\,y,\,a \mid x^4 = y^2 = a^4 = 1,\ xy = yx,\ a^{-1}xa = xy,\ a^{-1}ya = y} \\
                    G_{12b} &= \gen{x,\,y,\,a \mid x^4 = y^2 = a^4 = 1,\ xy = yx,\ a^{-1}xa = x^{-1}y,\ a^{-1}ya = y}
                \end{align*}
                Concentrating on the latter two groups, we will show they are both isomorphic to \(C_4 \rtimes C_4\),
                with the inversion action.
                First, \(G_{12a}\).
                Consider the element \(ax\), and so \(\gen{ax} = \{\,1,\,ax,\,y,\,axy\,\}\).
                By inspection, \(\gen{x} \cap \gen{ax} = \bm{1}\).
                So then:
                \[x^{-1}(ax)x = x^{-1}xaxy = axy = {(ax)}^{-1}\]
                Hence, \(G_{12a} = \gen{x} \rtimes \gen{ax} \cong C_4 \rtimes C_4\).

                Likewise for \(G_{12b}\), \(\gen{ax} = \{\,1,\,ax,\,a^2 y,\,x^{-1}a^{-1}\,\}\), and again \(\gen{x} \cap
                \gen{ax} = \bm{1}\).
                Additionally:
                \[x^{-1}(ax)x = ax^3 y = ax^{-1}y = xa\]
                Multiplying by \(x^4 = 1\) gives:
                \[x^4 xa = x^{-1}x^2 a = x^{-1}a^2 a = x^{-1}a^{-1}\]
                Hence \(G_{12b}\) is isomorphic to the same semidirect product, \(C_4 \rtimes C_4\).

                We can check that it is indeed valid to write \(C_4 \rtimes C_4\).
                We know \(\Aut{C_4} \cong C_2\) and so a homomorphism \(\varphi:C_4 \to \Aut{C_4}\) can map the
                generator to either the identity map or the inverse map.
                Hence we have only one non-trivial semidirect product.

            \item \(a^2 = y\).

                Conjugation by \(a\) cannot be \(\psi_6\) or \(\psi_8\) because then:
                \[a^2 = a^{-1}a^2 a = a^{-1}ya = x^2 y\]
                a contradiction.
                If it's \(\psi_5\) then let \(\bar{a} = xa\) and so:
                \[(xa)(xa) = x(axa^{-1})a^2 = x(x\psi_5)a^2 = x^2 y^2 = x^2\]
                and we are in the previous case.
                Likewise if conjugation by \(a\) is \(\psi_3\) then:
                \[(x^2 a)(x^2 a) = x^2(ax^2 a^{-1})a^2 = x^2(x^2\psi_3)a^2 = x^2 y^2 = x^2\]
                Finally, \(\psi_7\) gives:
                \[(xa)(xa) = xa^2(a^{-1}xa) = xa^2 x^3 y = x^4 y^2 = 1\]
                a contradiction, leaving only \(\psi_1\) as the final standing possibility, giving:
                \[G_{13} = \gen{x,\,y,\,a \mid x^4 = y^2 = a^4 = 1,\ xy = yx,\ ax = xa,\ ay = ya}\]
                Letting \(b = xy\):
                \[G_{13} = \gen{b,\,a \mid b^4 = a^4 = 1,\ ab = ba} \cong C_4 \times C_4\]

            \item \(a^2 = x^2 y\).

                For any group in this case, if we apply the automorphism \(\psi_8\), then we have:
                \[a^2\psi_8 = (x^2 y)\psi_8 = x^2 x^2 y = y\]
                So it will be isomorphic to a group from the previous case.

        \end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}
