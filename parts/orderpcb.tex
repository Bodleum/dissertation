% ====   Order p^3   ====
\section{Groups of Order \(p^3\)}
This classification is based on the one found on the Groupprops subwiki\footcite{pcubed}.
Let \(G\) be a group of order \(p^3\), where \(p\) is a prime number.
We will first gain a handle on \(G\) by describing its centre, and quotient by it.
If \(G\) is abelian, we know by the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups that it is isomorphic to one of:
\[ C_{p^3}, \quad C_{p^2} \times C_p \quad \text{or} \quad C_p \times C_p \times C_p\]
So from now on, we will focus on the non-abelian groups.

Denote the centre of \(G\) by \(Z\) and consider its order.
Lagrange's~Theorem tells us \(Z\) must have order dividing \(p^3\).
It cannot be \(p^3\) because \(G\) is non-abelian, and Lemma~\ref{lem:z_non_trivial} tells us that it cannot be 1.
If \(|Z| = p^2\), then \(|G/Z| = p\), so \(G/Z \cong C_p\).
However Lemma~\ref{lem:cyclic_over_centre} says that then \(G\) must be abelian, so then \(|Z|\) must be \(p\).
Then by our previous classification, \(G/Z\) is isomorphic to either \(C_{p^2}\) or \(C_p \times C_p\).
Lemma~\ref{lem:cyclic_over_centre} tells us that it must by the latter.

This gives us a handle to start investigating the structure of \(G\).
Another useful tool will be \emph{commutators}, which we will denote by \(\com{a}{b} = \comex{a}{b}\).
The \emph{derived subgroup} of \(G\), \(G' = \gen{\com{x}{y} \mid x,\,y \in G}\), is the smallest normal
subgroup such that \(G/G'\) is abelian.
We saw that \(G/Z\) is abelian, so \(G' \leqslant Z\), but because \(G'\) is non-trivial, we must have equality.

So far, we know \(G/Z \cong C_p \times C_p\), and that \(G' = Z\).
Now pick two elements, \(a\) and \(b\) so that \(aZ\) and \(bZ\) generate \(G/Z\).
So then \(G = \gen{Z,\,a,\,b}\).

Let \(z = \com{a}{b}\).
If \(z = 1\) then that means \(a\) and \(b\) commute.
And by definition, \(a\) commutes with \(Z\), so \(a \in Z\), which contradicts our choice of \(a\) as a generator of
\(G/Z\).
Hence \(z \neq 1\), and in particular, \(a\) and \(b\) do not commute.
Now we know \(G' = Z\) which has order \(p\), so \(Z \cong C_p\).
Moreover, \(z \in Z\), and \(z \neq 1\) so we can conclude that \(\gen{z} = Z\).
We can see that although \(a\) and \(b\) are not in \(Z\), \(a^p\) and \(b^p\) are, because \(aZ\) and \(bZ\) have order
\(p\) in \(G/Z\).
Considering the orders of \(a\) and \(b\) we have 3 cases:

\begin{enumerate}[\bfseries{Case} 1:]
    \item Both \(a\) and \(b\) have order \(p\).

        The above descriptions give the presentation:
        \[G = \gen{z,\,a,\,b \mid z^p = a^p = b^p = 1,\ az = za,\ bz = zb,\ \com{a}{b} = z}\]
        We can write an arbitrary \(g \in G\) as \(a^i b^j z^k\) for integers \(i\), \(j\) and \(k\) taken mod \(p\).
        Hence this presentation has order at most \(p^3\).

        Now consider the set:
        \[\left\{\,\unimat{\alpha}{\beta}{\gamma} \mid \alpha,\,\beta,\,\gamma \in \F_p\,\right\}\]
        It can be shown that this is a group under the usual matrix multiplication, and is known as the
        \emph{unitriangular group}\footcite{unitriangular}, denoted \(\UT_3(p)\).
        Taking:
        \[z = \unimat{0}{1}{0}, \quad a = \unimat{1}{0}{0} \quad \text{and} \quad b = \unimat{0}{0}{1}\]
        we can see that \(\UT_3(p)\) satisfies this presentation for \(p > 2\).
        (Indeed, the above presentation is the standard presentation definition for \(\UT_3(p)\)).
        Thus there is a single isomorphism class for this case.

        The group behaves differently when \(p = 2\) because we know that a group whose elements all have order either 1
        or 2 is abelian.
        So the elements cannot have order only 1 or 2.
        In particular:
        \[\unimat{1}{0}{1} \quad \text{and} \quad \unimat{1}{1}{1}\]
        have order 4.
        We can check that all other non-identity elements have order 2.
        Thus \(\UT_2(2) \cong D_8\).

    \item One element of each order \(p\) and \(p^2\).

        The roles of \(a\) and \(b\) are interchangeable, so we can take \(a\) to have order \(p^2\) and \(b\) to have
        order \(p\) without loss of generality.
        So \(\gen{a} \cong C_{p^2}\), and has index \(p\), so by Lemma~\ref{lem:index_p_normal} is normal.
        We noted that \(a^p \neq 1\) is in \(Z\), and so \(a^p\) is some power of \(z\), say \(a^p = z^r\), with \(r\)
        taken mod \(p\).

        We know that \(0 < r < p\) and I claim that we can take \(r = 1\) without loss of generality.
        This is because \(z^r\) is not 1, so must be some element of order \(p\) in \(Z\).
        Hence \(z^r\) generates \(Z\).
        So then there exists some integer \(s\), with \(0 < s < p\) such that \(sr \equiv 1 \pmod{p}\).
        Then say \(\bar{a} = a^s\) so:
        \[\bar{a}^p = {(a^s)}^p = {(a^p)}^s = {(z^r)}^s = z \pmod{p}\]
        Indeed we can take \(\bar{a}^p\) to be any power of \(z\) we want using a similar substitution.
        This is actually a sneaky application of Lemma~\ref{lem:semiisom}, because it will turn out that \(G\) can be
        written as a semidirect product.

        Take \(a^p = z\).
        Now because \(G = \gen{z,\,a,\,b}\), \(\gen{a} \cap \gen{b} = \bm{1}\).
        So we can conclude that \(G = \gen{a} \rtimes \gen{b}\).
        How does \(b\) conjugate \(a\)?
        Consider:
        \[\comex{a}{b} = \com{a}{b} = z = a^p\]
        So:
        \[b^{-1}ab = a^{p + 1}\]
        Thus:
        \[G \cong C_{p^2} \rtimes C_p\]
        With presentation:
        \[\gen{a,\,b \mid a^{p^2} = b^p = 1,\ b^{-1}ab = a^{p + 1}}\]

        When \(p = 2\), this reduces to the dihedral group, \(D_8\).
        However, we can see that for \(p > 2\), this is not isomorphic to the previous case, because \(\UT_3(p)\) has no
        element of order \(p^2\).

    \item Both \(a\) and \(b\) have order \(p^2\).

        We will show that by substitutions, this is equivalent to the above case when \(p > 2\).
        In the previous case, we saw that we can take \(a^p\) and \(b^p\) to be arbitrary powers of \(z\) using
        substitutions (which is Lemma~\ref{lem:semiisom} behind the scenes).
        So take \(a^p = z\) and \(b^p = z^{-1}\).
        Let \(d = ab\), and consider:
        \[ d^p = {(ab)}^p = abab\ldots ab\]
        We will collect together the \(a\)'s and \(b\)'s, maintaining equality with the commutator, \(\com{a}{b} = z\):
        \begin{align*}
            d^p &= ababab\ldots ab \\
            &= z aabbab\ldots ab \\
            &= z^2 aababb\ldots ab \\
            &= z^3 aaabbb\ldots ab \\
            &\ \,\vdots \\  % Weird spacing
            &= z^{\frac{p(p-1)}{2}} a^p b^p \tag{\(\dagger\)} \label{eqn:p_cubed_dagger}
        \end{align*}
        However, \(z^p = 1\) so:
        \[d^p = a^p b^p = zz^{-1} = 1\]
        So \(d\) has order \(p\), and we are back in the previous case.

        If \(p = 2\), (\ref{eqn:p_cubed_dagger}) does not hold, and the exponent of \(z\) is 1 in that case.
        So we have the relations:
        \[a^4 = b^4 = z^2 = 1, \quad a^2 = z, \quad b^2 = z^{-1} \quad \text{and} \quad \com{a}{b} = z\]
        Therefore:
        \[b^{-1}ab = az = a^3 = a^{-1}\]
        So we obtain the presenation:
        \[G = \gen{a,\,b \mid a^4 = b^4 = 1,\ a^2 = b^2,\ b^{-1}ab = a^{-1}}\]
        Which we recognise as the quaternion group, \(Q_8\).

\end{enumerate}

Hence any group of order \(p^3\) is isomorphic to one of:
\[%
    C_{p^3}, \quad%
    C_{p^2} \times C_p, \quad%
    C_p \times C_p \times C_p
\]
\[
    D_8, \quad \text{or} \quad%
    Q_8 \tag{when \(p = 2\)}
\]
\[
    \UT_3(p), \quad \text{or} \quad%
    C_{p^2} \rtimes C_p \tag{when \(p \geqslant 3\)}
\]
