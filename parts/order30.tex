\section{Groups of Order 30}
This classification is based on the one given in the cited Stack Exchange post\footcite{order30}.
Let \(G\) be a group of order \(30 = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5\).
So then \(G\) has a Sylow 3-subgroup, \(T\), and a Sylow 5-subgroup, \(F\).
Let \(H = TF\) and by Lagrange's Theorem, \(T \cap F = \bm{1}\), hence \(|H| = 15\) by Lemma~\ref{lem:setprodorder}.
We know from our classification of groups of order \(pq\) that \(H \cong C_{15}\).
Because \(|H| = 15 = \frac{30}{2}\), the index of \(H\) in \(G\) is 2, and we know a subgroup of index 2 is normal, so \(H \nrmsgp G\).

A Sylow 2-subgroup \(K \leqslant G\) has order 2, so \(K \cong C_2\).
Let \(\langle k \rangle = K\) and \(\langle h \rangle = H\).
By the same argument as above, \(H \cap K = \bm{1}\) and \(|HK| = 30\).
Hence \(G = HK\).
Moreover, \(G = H \rtimes K\).

By Lemma~\ref{lem:aut}:
\[\Aut{C_{15}} = \units{15} \cong {(\Zn{3} \times \Zn{5})}^\times \cong \units{3} \times \units{5} \cong C_2 \times C_4\]
A homomorphism, \(\psi:C_2 \to C_2 \times C_4\) preserves element order and we know \(\psi\) is determined by its effect on a generator.
So then \(k\psi\) has four possibilities: either the identity, or one of the three elements
of order 2.

Additionally, \(\psi\) preserves the Sylow subgroups of \(H\).
So write \(H = \langle h^3 \rangle \times \langle h^5 \rangle\), the direct product of its Sylow subgroups.
So the action of \(K\) on \(H\) is either trivial or by inversion on each of the Sylow subgroups of \(H\), giving us 4
possibilities:

\begin{enumerate}[\bfseries{Case} 1:]
    \item Trivial action on both Sylow subgroups.

        In this case, because the action is trivial on all of \(H\), we recover the direct product, \(G = H \times K
        \cong C_{30}\).
    \item Inversion on both Sylow subgroups.

        Here, \(K\) acts on all of \(H\), so we obtain:
        \[G = \langle\, h,\,k \mid h^{15} = k^2 = 1,\ k^{-1}hk = h^{-1}\,\rangle\]
        which we recognise as \(D_{30}\).
    \item Inversion on \(\langle h^5 \rangle\).

        We know already, from our classification of groups of order \(2p\), that \(C_3 \rtimes C_2 \cong D_6\).
        So then because the action on \(\langle h^3 \rangle\) is trivial:
        \[G = \langle h^3 \rangle \times (\langle h^5 \rangle \rtimes K) \cong C_5 \times D_6\]
    \item Inversion on \(\langle h^3 \rangle\).

        Similar to above, we obtain:
        \[G = \langle h^5 \rangle \times (\langle h^3 \rangle \rtimes K) \cong C_3 \times D_{10}\]
\end{enumerate}
