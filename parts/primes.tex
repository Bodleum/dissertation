% ====   Trivial and Prime order   ====
\section{First Classifications}
Let's start with the easiest case: groups of order 1.
Any group \(G\) must have an identity element, and so that's all our possible elements used up!
All groups of order 1 are isomorphic to the trivial group, \(\bm{1}\).

What about groups of prime order?
Let \(G\) be a group of order \(p\), where \(p\) is a prime number.
Then Lagrange's Theorem tell us all elements must have order 1 or \(p\).
Pick some \(x \in G\) with \(x\) having order \(p\).
Then \(\langle x \rangle = G\) so G is cyclic and \(G \cong C_p\).
