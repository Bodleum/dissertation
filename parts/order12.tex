\section{Groups of order 12}
We have seen that groups of order 12 have slightly different behaviour to groups of order \(4q\) in general, and we will
need this classification in order to classify groups of order 24.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:12}
    Any group of order 12 is isomorphic to one of:
    \[
        C_{12}, \quad%
        C_2 \times C_6, \quad%
        A_4, \quad%
        D_{12} \quad \text{or} \quad%
        \Dic_{12}
    \]
\end{theorem}

This section will be devoted to the proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:12}.
Let \(G\) be a group of order \(12 = 2^2 \cdot 3\), and \(n_3\) denote the number of Sylow 3-subgroups.
By Sylow's~Theorems:
\[n_3 \equiv 1 \pmod{3} \quad \text{and} \quad n_3 \mid 4\]
Hence:
\[n_3 = 1 \ \text{or} \ 4\]
Let \(H\) be a Sylow 2-subgroup and \(K\) be a Sylow 3-subgroup of \(G\), generated by \(x\).

Lagrange's Theorem tells us \(H\) has elements of order 1, 2, and 4, and \(K\) has elements of order 1 and 3.
Hence \(H \cap K = \bm{1}\).
Lemma~\ref{lem:setprodorder} tells us:
\[|HK| = |H| \cdot |K| = 12\]
Hence \(G = HK\) and \(H \cap K = \bm{1}\).

We have 4 cases, two choices for what the Sylow 2-subgroup is like, and 2 for if the Sylow 3-subgroup is normal or not.
Let's consider each case in turn, starting with if there is a normal Sylow 3-subgroup.

If \(K\) is normal, then we conclude that \(G = K \rtimes H\).
Let's consider the automorphism groups of the possibilities for \(H\).
Since an automorphism, \(\varphi\), must map generators to generators, \(\Aut{C_4} \cong C_2\) because \(C_4\) has two
generators.
An automorphism of \(V_4\) corresponds to a permutation of the three
non-identity elements, hence \(\Aut{V_4} \cong S_3\).


\begin{lemma}
    Let \(G\) be a group of order 12, with Sylow 2-subgroup isomorphic to \(C_4\) and normal Sylow 3-subgroup.
    Then \(G\) is isomorphic to one of:
    \[
        C_{12} \quad \text{or} \quad%
        \Dic_{12}
    \]
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    We have \(G = K \rtimes H\) for Sylow 3-subgroup \(K = \gen{x}\) and Sylow 2-subgroup \(H = \gen{y}\).
    We know \(\Aut{C_3} \cong C_2\) so a homomorphism \(\psi:H \to \Aut{K}\) maps \(H\) to the trivial group or to \(\gen{\beta:x
    \mapsto x^{-1}}\).

    If \(H\psi = \bm{1}\) then \(G = K \times H \cong C_3 \times C_4 \cong C_{12}\).

    If \(H\psi = \gen{\beta}\) then we have:
    \[G = \gen{x, y \mid x^3 = y^4 = 1,\ y^{-1}xy = x^{-1}}\]
    Now let \(a = xy^2\).
    And remember, \(y^{-1}xy = x^{-1}\) means \(x\) commutes with \(y^2\).
    So now:
    \[a^3 = xy^2xy^2xy^2 = x^3y^6 = y^2\]
    and:
    \[y^{-1}ay = y^{-1}xy^2y = (y^{-1}xy)y^2 = x^{-1}y^2 = y^2x^{-1} = a^{-1}\]
    So:
    \[G = \gen{a,\,y \mid a^6 = 1,\ a^3 = y^2,\ y^{-1}ay = a{-1}}\]
    which we recognise as \(\Dic_{12}\).
    This group is also sometimes denoted by \(T\).
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
    Let \(G\) be a group of order 12, with Sylow 2-subgroup isomorphic to \(V_4\) and normal Sylow 3-subgroup.
    Then \(G\) is isomorphic to one of:
    \[
        C_2 \times C_6 \quad \text{or} \quad%
        D_{12}
    \]

\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    We have \(G = K \rtimes H\) for Sylow 3-subgroup \(K = \gen{x}\) and Sylow 2-subgroup \(H = \gen{y, z}\).
    If \(\psi:H \to \Aut{K}\) is trivial then we obtain the direct product \(C_2 \times C_6\).

    We know \(\Aut{K} \cong C_2\), so there are 3 choices of elements in \(H\) to send to it, but they are all
    equivalent up to isomorphism, by Lemma~\ref{lem:semiisom}, taking \(\alpha\) to be the identity map.

    Furthermore, we know that \(H / \im{\psi} \cong \ker{\psi}\), so \(\ker{\psi}\) must be isomorphic to \(C_2\).
    Pick \(z\) so that it generates the kernel, and so the remaining generator, \(y\) is not in the kernel.
    Then:
    \[G = \gen{x,\,y,\,z \mid x^3 = y^2 = z^2 = 1,\ yz = zy,\ xz = zx,\ y^{-1}xy = x}\]
    Let \(a = xz\).
    So:
    \[a^3 = x^3z^3 = z\]
    and:
    \[ y^{-1}ay = y^{-1}xzy = y^{-1}xyz = x^{-1}z = x^2z = a^{-1}\]
    Hence:
    \[G = \gen{y,\,a \mid a^6 = y^2 = 1,\ y^{-1}ay = a^{-1}} \cong D_{12}\]
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
    Let \(G\) be a group of order 12, with Sylow 2-subgroup isomorphic to \(C_4\) and 4 Sylow 3-subgroups.
    Then \(G\) is isomorphic to \(C_{12}\).
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    If \(G\) has 4 Sylow 3-subgroups, then there are 8 elements of order 3 in \(G\).
    So the remaining 4 must form the Sylow 2-subgroup, hence it is normal.
    Thus \(G = H \rtimes K\).

    Let \(H = \gen{y}\).
    A homomorphism \(\psi:K \to \Aut{H} \cong C_2\), preserves order and together with Lagrange's Theorem means that
    the only possibility for \(\psi\) is trivial, i.e. \(K\psi = \bm{1}\).
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:uses_c3_automorphism}
    Let \(G\) be a group of order 12, with Sylow 2-subgroup isomorphic to \(v_4\) and 4 Sylow 3-subgroups.
    Then \(G\) is isomorphic to \(A_4\).
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    As before, we know the Sylow 2-subgroup is normal, and \(G = H \rtimes K\).
    Let \(H = \gen{y,\,z}\).
    A trivial homomorphism \(K\psi = \bm{1}\) yields the direct product, \(C_2 \times C_6\), but this has a normal (and
    hence unique) Sylow 3-subgroup.
    What non-trivial homomorphisms are there?

    The automorphism group, \(\Aut{H} \cong S_3\) is of order 6, and so has a unique subgroup of order 3, by
    Sylow's~Theorems.
    We know that a homomorphism \(\psi: K \to \Aut{H}\) is determined by where it sends the generator
    \(x\), so for \(\psi\) to be non-trivial, it must send \(x\) to an element of order 3 in \(\Aut{H}\).

    There are 2 such elements.
    Because \(\Aut{H} \cong S_3\), we will think of them as the permutations of order 3 of the set \(\{1, 2, 3\}\).
    Denote them \(a = (1\ 2\ 3)\) and \(b = (1\ 3\ 2)\).
    Notice that \(b = a^{-1}\), so we have homomorphisms:
    \[\psi_1:x \mapsto a \quad \text{and} \quad \psi_2:x \mapsto a^{-1}\]
    It appears we have 2 choices, but this is not the case.
    The inverse map, \(\beta:x \mapsto x^{-1}\), is an automorphism of K, and so by Lemma~\ref{lem:semiisom}, the
    corresponding semidirect products of \(\psi_1\) and \(\psi_2\) are isomorphic.
    Hence (up to isomorphism) there is one non-trivial homomorphism \(\psi:K \to \Aut{H}\).
    So \(x \in K\) acts by permuting the 3 non-identity elements of \(H\).

    We will show that in this case, \(G \cong A_4\).
    First, let's check \(A_4\) has the same subgroup structure as \(G\).
    There is a subgroup isomorphic to \(C_3\) in \(A_4\), generated by the 3-cycle \((1\ 2\ 3)\):
    \[\bar{K} = \gen{(1\ 2\ 3)}\]
    We can also find a subgroup isomorphic to \(V_4\):
    \[\bar{H} = \{\,1,\, (1\ 2)(3\ 4),\, (1\ 3)(2\ 4),\, (1\ 4)(2\ 3)\,\}\]
    Indeed, we can check that \(\bar{H}\) is normal in \(A_4\).
    We can see that \(\bar{H} \cap \bar{K} = \bm{1}\) because \(\bar{H}\) contains no 3-cycles, and that
    \(\bar{H}\bar{K} = A_4\).
    So we can conclude that \(A_4 = \bar{H} \rtimes \bar{K}\).

    Let's investigate how conjugation behaves.
    If we let \(\alpha = (1\ 2)(3\ 4)\), \(\beta = (1\ 4)(2\ 3)\) and \(\gamma = (1\ 2\ 3)\), then we can write an
    element of \(A_4\) as \(\alpha^i\beta^j\gamma^k\) for some \(i\), \(j\) and \(k\).
    Define \(\phi:A_4 \to G\) by \(\phi:\alpha^i\beta^j\gamma^k \mapsto x^{i}y^{j}z^{k}\).
    Then:
    \[\beta\phi = (\gamma^{-1}\alpha\gamma)\phi = c^{-1}ac = b\]
    So conjugation acts in the same way.
    Hence we can conclude that \(G \cong A_4\).
\end{proof}

The collection of these lemmas prove Theorem~\ref{thm:12}.
