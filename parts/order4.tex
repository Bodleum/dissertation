\section{Groups of order 4}
The Sylow theorems are not so helpful here, because any Sylow 2-subgroup will be of order 4, which
is just G.
Lagrange's Theorem tells us every element of \(G\) has order 1, 2 or 4.

If \(x \in G\) has order 4, then \(x\) generates G so \(G \cong C_4\).

If instead there is no element of order 4 in \(G\), then every \(x \in G\) except the identity is of
order 2.
Consider \(a, b \in G\) with \(a \neq b\), and their product, \(ab\).
It must be that \(ab\) is the third element of order 2, otherwise we reach a contradiction.
So it is easy to see that \(G \cong C_2 \times C_2\).

So any group of order 4 is isomorphic to one of:
\[C_4 \quad \text{or} \quad C_2 \times C_2\]
