\section{Groups of Order \(p^2\)}
Let \(G\) be a group of order \(p^2\).
First, we will prove a useful lemma:

\begin{lemma}
    If \(G\) is a \(p\)-group (i.e.\ a group of prime power order), then every subgroup of index \(p\) is normal.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    Let \(H\) be a subgroup of \(G\), with index \(p\).
    We know kernels are normal subgroups, so we will show that \(H\) is the kernel of some homomorphism. % TODO: Add this as a fact
    Let \(\Omega\) be the set of all cosets of \(H\).
    So by definition, \(|\Omega| = p\).
    By Lemma~\ref{lem:actionhom}, there is a homomorphism:
    \[\rho:G \to S_p\]
    Let's investigate the kernel of \(\rho\).
    If we have \(x \in \ker{\rho}\), then:
    \[(H1)x = H1 = H\]
    which means \(x \in H\).
    So the kernel of \(\rho\) is \(H\).
    Hence, \(H \nrmsgp G\).
\end{proof}

By Lagrange's Theorem, the elements of \(G\) have order 1, \(p\) or \(p^2\).

If \(x \in G\) has order \(p^2\), then \(x\) generates \(G\) so \(G \cong C_{p^2}\).

If \(G\) does not have an element of order \(p^2\) then all elements, except the identity, have order \(p\).
We know that \(G\) must have a subgroup of order \(p\), \(P\), and because \(p\) is prime, \(P \cong C_p\).
Pick a generator for \(P\), say \(x\) and an element \(y \in G\) such that \(y \notin P\).
Then \(y \neq x^i\) for any \(i\).

If \(y^j = x^i\) for some \(i\) and \(j\), then:
\[{(y^j)}^{1-j} = {(x^i)}^{1-j} = y^{j-j+1} = y = x^{i(1-j)} = x^k \quad \text{for some} \ k\text{,} \ \text{a
contradiction.}\]
So no power of \(y\) is equal to any power of \(x\).
Because \(y\) has order \(p\), it generates a subgroup of order \(p\), \(\bar{P}\), with \(P \cap \bar{P} = \bm{1}\).
The lemma tells us that both \(P\) and \(\bar{P}\) are normal, and by Lemma~\ref{lem:setprodorder}, \(|P\bar{P}| = p^2 =
|G|\), so:
\[G = P \times \bar{P} \cong C_p \times C_p\]

If \(G\) has no elements of order \(p\) or \(p^2\), then it only has elements of order 1, which is the trivial group.

Hence any group of order \(p^2\) is isomorphic to one of:
\[C_{p^2} \quad \text{or} \quad C_p \times C_p\]
