\section{Groups of Order 6}
Let \(G\) be a group of order 6, and \(n_3\) denote the number of Sylow 3-subgroups of \(G\).
Then by Theorem~\ref{thm:sylow3}:
\[n_3 \equiv 1 \ \text{(mod 3)} \quad \text{and} \quad n_3 \mid 2 \implies n_3 = 1\]
So \(G\) has one Sylow 3-subgroup, \(N\), and because 3 is prime, it is isomorphic to \(C_3\).
Let \(N = \langle x \rangle\).
Any Sylow 2-subgroup, \(H \leqslant G\), will have order 2, and so \(H \cong C_2\).
Let \(H = \langle y \rangle\).
Lagrange's Theorem tells us that \(N\) has elements of orders 1 and 3, and \(H\) has elements of
order 1 and 2 hence:
\[N \cap H = \bm{1}\]

By Lemma~\ref{lem:setprodorder}:
\[|NH| = \frac{|N| \cdot |H|}{|N \cap H|} = \frac{3 \cdot 2}{1} = 6\]
So \(G = NH\), \(N \unlhd G\) and \(N \cap H = \bm{1}\), which means \(G = N \rtimes H\), the
semidirect product of \(N\) by \(H\).

Now we need to determine \(\Aut{N}\).
An automorphism, \(\varphi\) of \(N\) preserves element order.
In particular, \(\varphi\) maps generators to generators.
Hence, \(x\varphi = x\) or \(x^2\) because they are the generators of \(N\).
So \(\Aut{N} \cong C_2\).

Now we want a homomorphism \(\psi:H \to \Aut{N}\).
If \(\psi\) is trivial, then it maps \(H\) to the trivial group, so every element of \(H\) gets sent
to the trivial automorphism.
If \(\psi\) is not trivial, then at least one element of \(H\) is not sent to the trivial
automorphism.
It cannot be 1 because then element order is not preserved, so it must be the generator, \(y\).
Hence we obtain 2 possibilities for \(G\):

\begin{enumerate}[\bfseries{Case} 1:]
    \item
        \begin{equation*}
        \begin{aligned}
            G &= \langle\, x, y \mid x^3 = y^2 = 1,\ y^{-1}xy = x \,\rangle \\
            &=\langle\, x, y \mid x^3 = y^2 = 1,\ xy = yx \,\rangle \\
            &= C_3 \times C_2 \cong C_6
        \end{aligned}
        \end{equation*}

    \item
        \begin{equation*}
        \begin{aligned}
            G &= \langle\, x, y \mid x^3 = y^2 = 1,\ y^{-1}xy = x^{-1}
            \,\rangle \\
            &\cong D_6
        \end{aligned}
        \end{equation*}
\end{enumerate}

These are clearly not isomorphic, because \(C_6\) is abelian, and \(D_6\) is not.

Hence \(G\) is isomorphic one of:
\[C_6 \quad \text{or} \quad D_6\]

% ====   Groups of order 2p   ====
\section{Generalisation to Groups of Order \(2p\)}
Now that we have seen groups of order 6, let's try and work towards a more general case: groups of
order 2 times a prime number.
So let \(G\) be a group of order \(2p\) where \(p\) is a prime number, and \(n_p\) denote the number
of Sylow p-subgroups of \(G\).
Then by Theorem~\ref{thm:sylow3}:
\[n_p \equiv 1 \ \text{(mod \(p\))} \quad \text{and} \quad n_p \mid 2 \implies n_p = 1\]
So \(G\) has one Sylow \(p\)-subgroup, say \(N\), and it is isomorphic to \(C_p\).
Let \(N = \langle x \rangle\).
A Sylow 2-subgroup, \(H \leqslant G\) will have order 2 so \(H \cong C_2\).
Let \(H = \langle y \rangle\).
Lagrange's Theorem tells us that \(N\) has elements of orders 1 and \(p\), and \(H\) has elements of
order 1 and 2 hence:
\[N \cap H = \bm{1}\]

By Lemma~\ref{lem:setprodorder}:
\[|NH| = \frac{|N| \cdot |H|}{|N \cap H|} = \frac{p \cdot 2}{1} = 2p\]
So \(G = N \rtimes H\) as before.

We know by Lemma~\ref{lem:aut} that \(\Aut{N} \cong \Zn{p}^*\), so let's look for the elements of
order 2.
An element \(x \in \Zn{p}^*\) of order 2 satisfies \(x^2 = 1\), hence \(x = 1\) or \(-1\).
But 1 has order 1, so \(x\) can only be \(-1\).
From the proof of Lemma~\ref{lem:aut}, this corresponds to the inverse map \(\beta:x \mapsto
x^{-1}\).

Now we want a homomorphism \(\psi: H \to \Aut{N}\).
By the same argument as for groups of order 6, we have two possibilities for \(G\):

\begin{enumerate}[\bfseries{Case} 1:]
    \item
        \begin{equation*}
        \begin{aligned}
            G &= \langle\, x, y \mid x^p = y^2 = 1,\ y^{-1}xy = x \,\rangle \\
            &= C_p \times C_2 \cong C_{2p}
        \end{aligned}
        \end{equation*}
    \item
        \begin{equation*}
        \begin{aligned}
            G &= \langle\, x, y \mid x^p = y^2 = 1,\ y^{-1}xy = x^{-1}
            \,\rangle \\
            &\cong D_{2p}
        \end{aligned}
        \end{equation*}
\end{enumerate}

Again, these are clearly not isomorphic, because \(C_{2p}\) is abelian, and \(D_{2p}\) is not.

Hence a group of order \(2p\) is isomorphic to one of:
\[C_{2p} \quad \text{or} \quad D_{2p}\]

% ====   Groups of order 4   ====
\section{Groups of order 4}
From the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, we know that a group \(G\) of order 4 could
be isomorphic to one of \(C_4\) and \(C_2 \times C_2\).
Now to show that these are the only possibilities.
The Sylow theorems are not so helpful here, because any Sylow 2-subgroup will be of order 4, which
is just G.
Lagrange's Theorem tells us every element of \(G\) has order 1, 2 or 4.

If \(x \in G\) has order 4, then \(x\) generates G so \(G \cong C_4\).

If instead there is no element of order 4 in \(G\), then every \(x \in G\) except the identity is of
order 2.
Consider \(a, b \in G\) with \(a \neq b\), and their product, \(ab\).
It must be that \(ab\) is the third element of order 2, otherwise we reach a contradiction.
So it is easy to see that \(G \cong C_2 \times C_2\).

So any group of order 4 is isomorphic to one of:
\[C_4 \quad \text{or} \quad C_2 \times C_2\]

% ====   Groups of order p^2   ====
\section{Generalisation to Groups of Order \(p^2\)}
Let \(G\) be a group of order \(p^2\).
By Lagrange's Theorem, the elements of \(G\) have order 1, \(p\) or \(p^2\).

If \(x \in G\) has order \(p^2\), then \(x\) generates \(G\) so \(G \cong C_{p^2}\).

If \(G\) does not have an element of order \(p^2\) then all elements, except the identity, have order \(p\).
We know that \(G\) must have a subgroup of order \(p\), \(P\), and because \(p\) is prime, \(P \cong C_p\).
Pick a generator for \(P\), say \(x\) and an element \(y \in G\) such that \(y \notin P\).
Then \(y \neq x^i\) for any \(i\).

If \(y^j = x^i\) for some \(i\) and \(j\), then:
\[{(y^j)}^{1-j} = {(x^i)}^{1-j} = y^{j-j+1} = y = x^{i(1-j)} = x^k \quad \text{for some} \ k\text{,} \ \text{a
contradiction.}\]
So no power of \(y\) is equal to any power of \(x\).
Because \(y\) has order \(p\), it generates a subgroup of order \(p\), \(\bar{P}\) with \(P \cap \bar{P} = \bm{1}\).
By Lemma~\ref{lem:setprodorder}, \(|P\bar{P}| = p^2 = |G|\) so:
\[G = P \times \bar{P} \cong C_p \times C_p\]

If \(G\) has no elements of order \(p\) or \(p^2\), then it only has elements of order 1, which is the trivial group.

Hence any group of order \(p^2\) is isomorphic to one of:
\[C_{p^2} \quad \text{or} \quad C_p \times C_p\]


% TODO: Check the above proof is actually legit

% Let \(G\) be a group of order \(p^2\) and consider \(\z{(G)} \unlhd G\).
% By Lagrange's Theorem, \(\z{(G)}\) has order 1, \(p\) or \(p^2\).
%
% If \(|\z{(G)}| = p^2\) then \(G\) is abelian.
%
% Assume \(|\z{(G)}| \neq p^2\) and consider an element \(x \in G\) but \(x
% \notin \z{(G)}\), and it's centraliser, \(\C_G{(x)}\).
% We know \(\C_G{(x)} \leqslant G\) and that \(x \in \C_G{(x)}\), so \(|\C_G{(x)|
% \neq 1}\), and so by Lagrange's Theorem, it must be that \(|\C_G{(x)}| = p\).
% So:
% \[|x^G| = |G:\C_G{(x)}| = \frac{p^2}{p} = p\]
%
% The Class Equation, \(|G| = |\z{(G)}| + \sum^k_{i=1}|x_i^G|\), tells us
% \(|\z{(G)}|\) must be a multiple of \(p\) because both  \(|G|\) and \(|x^G|\)
% are multiples of \(p\). Hence \(|\z{(G)}| = p\).
%
% So then \(|G:\z{(G)}| = p\), which means \(G/\z{(G)} \cong C_p\).

%     \item Show \(G\) must be abelian. Result follows from FTFAB\@.

% ====   Groups of order pq   ====
\section{Groups of Order \(pq\)}
Let \(G\) be a group of order \(pq\) where \(p\), \(q\) are prime numbers with \(p > q\), and let \(n_p\) and \(n_q\)
denote the number of Sylow p-subgroups and Sylow q-subgroups of \(G\) respectively.
Then by Theorem~\ref{thm:sylow3}:
\[n_p \equiv 1 \ \text{(mod \(p\))} \quad \text{and} \quad n_p \mid q \implies n_p = 1\]
\[n_q \equiv 1 \ \text{(mod \(q\))} \implies n_q = 1,\ q+1,\ 2q+1,\ \dots \quad \text{and} \quad n_q \mid p\]

So \(G\) has a unique Sylow \(p\)-subgroup, say \(P \unlhd G\), and a Sylow \(q\)-subgroup, \(Q \leqslant G\).
Because \(p\) and \(q\) are prime numbers, \(P \cong C_p\) and \(Q \cong C_q\).
Pick generators for each, say \(\rangle x \langle  = P\) and \(\rangle y \langle = Q\).
We have 2 possibilities for \(n_q\): \(p-1\) is a multiple of \(q\) or 1.

\begin{enumerate}[\bfseries{Case} 1:]
    \item \(q \nmid p - 1\).

        If \(p-1\) \emph{is not} a multiple of \(q\) then \(n_q = 1\) and \(Q \unlhd G\), hence:
        \[G = P \times Q \cong C_{pq}\]

    \item \( q \mid p - 1\).

        If \(p-1\) \emph{is} a multiple of \(q\) then \(n_q = p\) and so \(Q\) is \emph{not} normal in \(G\).
        By Lagrange's Theorem, \(P \cap Q = \bm{1}\) and by Lemma~\ref{lem:setprodorder}, \(|PQ| = pq\).
        Hence, as well as the direct product, we have \(G = P \rtimes Q\), some non-trivial semidirect product.

        By Lemma~\ref{lem:aut}, \(\Aut{C_p} \cong \Zn{p}^* \cong C_{p-1}\).
        So if \(\nu \in \Zn{p}^*\), then \(x \mapsto x^\nu\) is an automorphism.
        We know also that \(C_{p-1}\) has a unique subgroup of order \(q\),
        hence \(G\) has the presentation:

        \[G = \langle \, x, y, \mid x^p = y^q = 1,\ y^{-1}xy = x^\alpha \, \rangle\]
        where \(\alpha\) is a generator for the subgroup of order \(q\) in
        \(\Zn{p}^*\).

        Notice that picking different generators are equivalent up to isomorphism because the composition of two
        isomorphisms is an isomorphism.
\end{enumerate}

So any group of order \(pq\) is isomorphic to either:
\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
    C_{pq} \quad \text{or} \quad \langle \, x, y \mid x^p = y^q = 1,\ y^{-1}xy
    = x^\alpha \, \rangle \qquad &\text{if} \ q \mid p-1 \\
    C_{pq} \qquad &\text{if} \ q \nmid p-1
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}

\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:iso2}
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:iso3}
\end{theorem}

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:setprodorder}
    For a group \(G\) with \(N \leqslant G\) and \(H \leqslant G\), then
    \[|NH| = |\{nh \mid n \in N, h \in H\}| = \frac{|N| \cdot |H|}{|N \cap H|}\]
\end{lemma}
% TODO: maybe prove?

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:aut}
    The automorphism group of \(C_n\) is isomorphic to the multiplicative group
    of integers mod \(n\).

    i.e. \(\Aut{C_n} \cong \Zn{n}^*\)
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    Let \(C_n = \langle x \rangle\).
    Any automorphism, \(\varphi\) of \(C_n\) has the property:
    \[(x^i)\varphi = {(x\varphi)}^i\]
    Hence \(\varphi\) is determined by it's effect on a generator, \(x\), and preserves element
    order.
    In particular, \(\varphi\) sends generators to generators.
    So for \(\varphi\) to be an automorphism, it must send \(x\) to another generator, say \(x^k\).
    An element \(x^k\) generates \(C_n\) if \(x^k\) has order \(n\), i.e.\ when \(k\) and \(n\) are co-prime.
    Denote the automorphism sending \(x\) to \(x^k\) by \(\varphi_k\).

    Let's now investigate how these automorphisms behave.
    Let \(\varphi_k, \varphi_l \in \Aut{C_n}\), and consider:
    \[x\varphi_k\varphi_l = (x^k)\varphi_l = {(x^k)}^l = x^{(kl)} = x\varphi_{kl} \quad \text{(mod \(n\))}\]
    Because multiplication modulo \(n\) is commutative, \(x^{kl} = x^{lk}\), so \(\Aut{C_n}\) is abelian.

    Now consider \(\theta:\Aut{C_n} \to \Zn{n}^*\) defined by \(\varphi_k\theta = k\).
    We will show \(\theta\) is an isomorphism.
    Every \(k \in \Zn{n}^*\) is co-prime to \(n\) and so \(x^k\) is a generator of \(C_n\), hence there is some \(\varphi_k
    \in \Aut{C_n}\) such that \(\varphi_k\theta = k\).
    So \(\theta\) is surjective.
    If \(\varphi_k\theta = \varphi_l\theta\) then \(k = l\), so \(\theta\) is also injective.
    Finally, \(\theta\) is a homomorphism because:
    \[(\varphi_k\varphi_l)\theta = \varphi_{kl}\theta = kl = (\varphi_k\theta)(\varphi_l\theta)\]
    So \(\theta:\Aut{C_n} \to \Zn{n}^*\) is an isomorphism.
\end{proof}



% ====   Groups of order 12   ====
\section{Groups of order 12}
Let \(G\) be a group of order \(12 = 2^2 \cdot 3\), and \(n_3\) and \(n_2\) denote the number of Sylow 3-subgroups and
Sylow 2-subgroups of G respectively.
By Theorem~\ref{thm:sylow3}:
\[n_2 \equiv 1 \text{ (mod 2) and } n_2 \mid 3 \implies n_2 = 1\]
\[n_3 \equiv 1 \text{ (mod 3) and } n_3 \mid 4 \implies n_3 = 1 \ \text{or} \ 4\]

So \(G\) has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup of order 4, say \(H \unlhd G\), and we have already classified groups of order 4,
so \(H\) is isomorphic to either \(V_4\) (the Klein 4 group) or \(C_4\).
A Sylow 3-subgroup, \(K \leqslant G\) will have order 3, so \(K \cong C_3\).

Lagrange's Theorem tells us \(H\) has elements of order 1, 2, and 4, and \(K\) has elements of order 1 and 3.
Hence \(H \cap K = \bm{1}\).
Lemma~\ref{lem:setprodorder} tells us:
\[|HK| = \frac{|H| \cdot |K|}{|H \cap K|} = 12\]
Hence \(G = HK\), \(H \unlhd G\), and \(H \cap K = \bm{1}\).
If we consider groups with 4 Sylow 3-subgroups then we can conclude that they are some semidirect product, \(G = H
\rtimes K\).

Since an automorphism, \(\varphi\), must map generators to generators, \(\Aut{C_4} \cong C_2\) because \(C_4\) has two
generators.
An automorphism of \(V_4\) corresponds to a permutation of the three
non-identity elements, hence \(\Aut{V_4} \cong S_3\).

\begin{enumerate}[\bfseries{Case} 1:]
    \item \(H \cong C_4\) i.e. \(G \cong C_4 \rtimes C_3\).

        A homomorphism \(\psi:K \to \Aut{H} \cong C_2\), preserves order and together with Lagrange's Theorem means that
        the only possibility for \(\psi\) is trivial, i.e. \(K\psi = \bm{1}\).

        Hence \(G \cong C_4 \times C_3 \cong C_{12}\).

    \item \(H \cong V_4\) i.e. \(G \cong (C_2 \times C_2) \rtimes C_3\).

        A trivial homomorphism \(K\psi = \bm{1}\) yields the direct product.

        % TODO: Show this is A4
        Still need to show this is \(A_4\).
\end{enumerate}

If we instead consider \(G\) where \(K \unlhd G\), i.e. \(G = K \rtimes H\), then we again have two cases:

\begin{enumerate}[\bfseries{Case} 1:]
    \item \(H \cong C_4\) i.e. \(G \cong C_3 \rtimes C_4\).

        Say \(K = \langle x \rangle\) and \(H = \langle y \rangle\).
        We know \(\Aut{C_3} \cong C_2\) so a homomorphism \(\psi\) maps \(H\) to the trivial group or to \(\langle
        \beta:x \mapsto x^{-1} \rangle\).

        If \(H\psi = \bm{1}\) then \(G = K \times H \cong C_4 \times C_3\), which we have already seen.

        If \(H\psi = \langle \beta \rangle\) then we have:
        \[G = \langle\, x, y \mid x^3 = y^4 = 1,\ y^{-1}xy = x^{-1}\,\rangle\]
        % TODO: Classify this

    \item \(H \cong V_4\) i.e. \(G \cong C_3 \rtimes (C_2 \times C_2)\).

        If \(\psi:H \to \Aut{K}\) is trivial then we obtain the direct product again.

        The image of a non-trivial homomorphism \(\psi:H \to \Aut{K}\) is isomorphic to \(C_2\), so by
        Theorem~\ref{thm:iso1}: \(\ker{\theta} \cong C_2\).

        Choose \(a, b \in H\) with \(a, b \neq 1\) such that \(a\theta = \beta:x \mapsto x^{-1}\) and \(b\theta =
        \text{id}:x \mapsto x\).
        Then:
        \[G = \langle\, x, a, b \mid x^3 = a^2 = b^2 = 1,\ ab = ba,\ a^{-1}xa = x^{-1},\ b^{-1}xb = x\,\rangle\]
        Let \(y = xb\).
        The order of \(y = \lcm{(\order{(x)}, \order{(b)})} = \lcm{(2, 3)} = 6\) because \(x\) and \(b\) commute.
        So:
        \[y^3 = x^3b^3 = b\]
        and
        \[ a^{-1}ya = a^{-1}xba = a^{-1}xab = x^{-1}b = x^2b = y^2y^3 = y^{-1}\]
        Hence:
        \[G = \langle\, a, y \mid y^6 = a^2 = 1,\ a^{-1}ya = y^{-1}\,\rangle
        \cong D_{12}\]
\end{enumerate}

So a group \(G\) of order 12 is isomorphic to one of:
\[
    C_{12}, \quad%
    C_2 \times C_6, \quad%
    A_4, \quad%
    D_{12}, \quad \text{or} \quad%
    \langle\, x, y \mid x^3 = y^4 = 1,\ y^{-1}xy = x^{-1}\,\rangle
\]

\section{Generalisation to Groups of order \(4p\)}
Suppose \(G\) is a group of order \(4p\) where \(p\) is a prime number.
Let \(n_2\) denote the number of Sylow 2-subgroups.

% TODO: Sketch

\section{Groups of Order 30}
Let \(G\) be a group of order \(30 = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5\), and let \(n_3\) and \(n_5\) denote the number of Sylow
3-subgroups and Sylow 5-subgroups of \(G\) respectively.
Then by Theorem~\ref{thm:sylow3}:
\[n_3 = 1 \ \text{or} \ 10 \quad \text{and} \quad n_5 = 1 \ \text{or} \ 6\]
If \(n_3 = 10\), then there are 20 elements of order 3, and if \(n_5 = 6\) then
there are 24 elements of order 5 in \(G\).
\(G\) only has 30 elements, so then either:
\[n_3 = 1 \ \text{and} \ n_5 = 6, \quad n_3 = 10 \ \text{and} \ n_5 = 1 \quad \text{or} \quad n_3 = n_5 = 1\]
So if \(T\) is a Sylow 3-subgroup of \(G\) and \(F\) is a Sylow 5-subgroup, then at least one must be normal in \(G\).
So \(T \unlhd G\) or \(F \unlhd G\) or both.

Let \(H = TF\) and by Lagrange's Theorem, \(T \cap F = \bm{1}\), hence \(|H| = 15\) by Lemma~\ref{lem:setprodorder}.
We know from our classification of groups of order \(pq\) that \(H \cong C_{15}\).
Notice that a Sylow 2-subgroup \(K \leqslant G\) has order 2, so \(K \cong C_2\).
By the same argument as above, \(H \cap K = \bm{1}\) and \(|HK| = 30\).
Hence \(G = HK\).

Because \(|H| = 15 = \frac{30}{2}\), the index of \(H\) in \(G\) is 2, and we know a subgroup of index 2 is normal, so \(H \unlhd G\).
Moreover, \(G = H \rtimes K\).

By Lemma~\ref{lem:aut}:
\[\Aut{C_{15}} = \Zn{15}^* \cong {(\Zn{3} \times \Zn{5})}^* \cong \Zn{3}^* \times \Zn{5}^* \cong C_2 \times C_4\]

Let \(\langle x, y \rangle = C_2 \times C_4\).
A homomorphism, \(\psi:C_2 \to C_2 \times C_4\) preserves element order, and there are 3 elements of order 2 in \(C_2
\times C_4\): \((x, 1)\), \((1, y^2)\) and \((x, y^2)\).
We know \(\psi\) is determined by it's effect on a generator, so if \(\langle z \rangle = K\) then \(z\psi\) has four
possibilities:

\begin{enumerate}[\bfseries{Case} 1:]
    \item \(z\psi = (1, 1)\).

        When \(z\psi = (1, 1)\), then \(\psi\) is the trivial homomorphism, and
        so we obtain:
        \[G \cong C_2 \times C_{15} \cong C_{30}\]

    \item \(z\psi = (x, 1)\).
    \item \(z\psi = (1, y^2)\).
    \item \(z\psi = (x, y^2)\).
\end{enumerate}

% \begin{definition}[Direct Product]
%     For groups \(N\) and \(H\), the \emph{direct product}, \(G = N\times H\) is a
%     group of ordered pairs of elements \((n, h)\) where \(n \in N\) and \(h \in
%     H\) with the operation: \[(n_1, h_1)(n_2, h_2) = (n_1n_2, h_1h_2)\]

%     If \(G = N \times H\) then \(N \unlhd G\) and \(H \unlhd G\).
