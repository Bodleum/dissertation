\chapter{Groups of Prime-Power Orders}\label{ch:prime_power_order}
In this chapter, we will focus on classifying groups which have order \(p\), \(p^2\) and \(p^3\), for a prime number
\(p\).
These three will be proven generally, applying to any prime.
However, we will leave the particular case of \(16 = 2^4\) for Chapter~\ref{ch:particular_order} because it is
significantly harder.

\chapter{Groups of Composite Orders}\label{ch:composite_order}
Now we will classify groups which have order a composite number, focusing only on numbers which have two distinct prime
factors, \(p\) and \(q\).
Groups of order \(pq\) will be classified fully, but to attempt the same for \(p^2 q\) is beyond the scope of this
report.
Hence we will deal with groups which have order \(4q\) and \(2p^2\).

\chapter{Groups of Particular Orders}\label{ch:particular_order}
Finally, let's deal with the groups of particular order which have been missed by our generally classifications.
Namely these orders are \(12\), \(24\), \(30\), and \(16\).
