\section{Groups of Order \(p^2q\)}
Let \(p\) and \(q\) be distinct prime numbers, and \(G\) be a group of order \(p^2q\).
To classify \(G\) in full generality is beyond this report, so we will focus on the cases \(|G| = 4q\) and \(|G| =
3p^2\).

\subsection{\(4q\)}
Let \(G\) be a group of order \(4p\), and require \(p > 3\).
And let \(n_q\) denote the number of Sylow \(q\)-subgroups.
The \(n_q\) must divide 4, so could be 1, 2 or 4, and must be congruent to 1 mod \(q\).
If \(q \leqslant 3\) then \(G\) could have 4 or 2 Sylow \(q\)-subgroups, but we have already classified those orders,
which is why we took \(q > 3\).
Hence \(G\) has a normal Sylow \(q\)-subgroup, \(Q \cong C_q\).
Let \(x\) generate \(Q\).

Lagrange's Theorem, together with Lemma~\ref{lem:setprodorder}, tell us that a Sylow 2-subgroup, \(T\), intersects
trivially with \(Q\), and \(|QT| = |G|\).
Hence, \(G = Q \rtimes T\).

We know by Lemma~\ref{lem:aut}, that \(\Aut{Q} \cong C_{q-1}\).
So we have two cases:

\begin{enumerate}[\bfseries{Case} 1:]
    \item \(T \cong V_4\) i.e. \(G \cong C_q \rtimes V_4\).

    We saw in our classification of groups of order \(2p\), that \(\units{q}\) has a unique element of order 2,
    corresponding to the inversion map.
    So Lemma~\ref{lem:semiisom} tells us that there is only a single non-trivial homomorphism \(\psi:T \to \Aut{Q}\).

    If \(\psi\) is trivial, then we obtain the product:
    \[G \cong C_q \times V_4 \cong C_{2q} \times C_2\]
    If \(\psi\) maps \(T\) to the subgroup generated by the inversion map, isomorphic to \(C_2\).
    Therefore the kernel is isomorphic to \(C_2\), so pick \(z\) such that it generates the kernel.
    Denote the other generator of \(T\) by \(y\), then we obtain the following presentation:
    \[G = \langle\, x,\,y,\,z \mid x^q = y^2 = z^2 = 1,\ yz = zy,\ xz = zx,\ y^{-1}xy = x^{-1}\,\rangle\]
    Now let \(a = xz\), and in a similar calculation to when we classified groups of order 12, we will show that \(G
    \cong D_{4p}\).

    Firstly, notice that the order of \(a\) is \(4q\), and:
    \[a^q = x^q z^q = z \quad \text{and} \quad a^{q-1} = x^{q-1} z^{q-1} = x^{q-1}\]
    Now consider:
    \[y^{-1}ay = y^{-1}xzy = y^{-1}xyz = x^{-1}z = a^{q-1} a^q = a^{2q-1} = a^{-1}\]
    Hence:
    \[G = \langle\, a,\,y \mid a^{2q} = y^2 = 1,\ y^{-1}ay = a^{-1}\,\rangle\]
    which we recognise as \(D_{4p}\).

    \item \(T \cong C_4\) i.e. \(G \cong C_q \rtimes C_4\).
\end{enumerate}
